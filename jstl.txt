jstl -> jsp standart tag library

allows to communicate the servlet with the jsp file without having to write
their respective code on the other one (servlet + html and jspo + java).

jsp need the <%@ taglib prefix="any" uri ="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" %>

there are 3 main tags to use core,sql and function
core: are the core tags of jstl such as out to print, forEach to iterate
sql: allows to connect to database and perform query and operations
function: has some string functions such as length, split ...


jar file -> jstl-1.2 e javax. ... .jstl

tags

<any:out ... > -> we use the prefix to identify the jstl tag and then we input
a command such as out, there are many more.

it is possible to send objects from the servlet, but to get the values it is
necessary a getter and setter and we extract the object value with the command
${object.value}

core: 
<c:forEach items = "${label}" var = "s">
        ${s} <br>
</c:forEach>

sql:
<!--Setting database-->
<sql:setDataSource var ="db" driver ="org.postgresql.Driver" url="jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/videos_test" user = "postgres" password = "0123456789"/>
<!--querying and storing result statement in rs-->
<sql:query var = "rs" dataSource="${db}">select * from video</sql:query>

function:
${function:length(str)}
