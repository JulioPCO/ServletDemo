jstl -> jsp standart tag library

allows to communicate the servlet with the jsp file without having to write
their respective code on the other one (servlet + html and jspo + java).

jsp need the <%@ taglib prefix="any" uri ="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl" %>

jar file -> jstl-1.2 e javax. ... .jstl

tags

<any:out ... > -> we use the prefix to identify the jstl tag and then we input
a command such as out, there are many more.

it is possible to send objects from the servlet, but to get the values it is
necessary a getter and setter and we extract the object value with the command
${object.value}
