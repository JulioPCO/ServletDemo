JSP allows to write html code and integrate with servlet without having to 
write the html code inside the servlet. Jsp automatically runs a servlet
class structure inside html.

<%! ... %> -> this is how to declare variables outside get, post,... it is 
like declaring variables inside the class but not inside the method. this
structure is called declaration.

<% ... %> -> this is how to write the code on your method (get,post,...), 
this structure is called scriptlet.

<%@ page attribute="value"  ... %> attributes such as import,extends,...
are included in the page, this is  called directive there are other directives
such sd @include and @taglib
@include file= "filename": allows to include files or others jsp to the jsp 
@Taglib uri="uri" prefix = "fx": allows to include tags from other uri
e.g <fx:name> -> tag name from prefix fx in determined uri.

<%= ... %> -> out.print(...), this is an expression

JSP also have implicits builtin objects such as request, response, 
pagecontext, out(jsp printwriter), session, application(jsp servletcontext)
 and config. pagecontext allows to set attributes to the page scope,
 the others are the same as their servlet pairs.

To handle exceptions in jsp a jsp file can be created as a isErrorPage and 
others jsp can refer the error to this jsp with pageError, both are page 
attributes.

netbeans is a tool that converts your jsp to servlet
