filters are located between client and servlet and perform operations before
entering the servlet, e.g log, security check... Filters allow to generalize
operations for a group of servlets and avoid having to perform the operation
inside each servlet.

There can be multiple filters inbetween client and servlet and a filterchain
is necessary to organize the order of filters
